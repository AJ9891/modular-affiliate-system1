- File size and type
- Upload date
- Active/inactive status

### Query Download Logs

```sql
-- Get all downloads for a file
SELECT * FROM download_logs
WHERE download_id = 'your-download-id'
ORDER BY downloaded_at DESC;

-- Get download count by email
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as download_count
FROM download_logs
GROUP BY email
ORDER BY download_count DESC;

-- Get downloads by funnel
SELECT 
  d.title,
  COUNT(dl.id) as downloads
FROM downloads d
LEFT JOIN download_logs dl ON d.id = dl.download_id
WHERE dl.funnel_id = 'your-funnel-id'
GROUP BY d.id, d.title;
```

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ Users can only manage their own files
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ File size limits
- ✅ Authenticated uploads only
- ✅ Public downloads (with tracking)

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use Clear Titles** - Help users understand what they're downloading
2. **Add Descriptions** - Provide context about the download
3. **Track Funnels** - Always include `funnelId` for attribution
4. **Require Email** - Set `require_email: true` to capture leads
5. **Monitor Storage** - Check Supabase storage usage regularly
6. **Optimize Files** - Compress PDFs before uploading

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails

1. Check file size (max 50MB)
2. Verify file type is allowed
3. Ensure user is authenticated
4. Check Supabase storage bucket exists

### Download Link Doesn't Work

1. Verify download is `is_active: true`
2. Check storage bucket is public
3. Ensure download ID is correct
4. Check RLS policies in Supabase

### Email Not Capturing

1. Verify `require_email: true` in downloads table
2. Check leads table exists
3. Verify email format is valid
4. Check API logs for errors

## 📝 Example Use Cases

1. **Free Ebook Funnel** - Give away ebook, capture email, upsell course
2. **Resource Library** - Members-only downloads section
3. **Lead Magnets** - PDF guides, checklists, templates
4. **Bonus Content** - Exclusive downloads for customers
5. **Templates** - Downloadable business templates

## 🔗 Integration with Funnels

### Visual Builder Integration

When building funnels, you can:
1. Upload lead magnet to `/downloads`
2. Copy the download link
3. Add `DownloadGate` component to funnel
4. Track conversions with `funnelId`

### Example Funnel Flow

```
Landing Page
    ↓
Email Capture (DownloadGate)
    ↓
Download File (tracked)
    ↓
Thank You Page
    ↓
Email Sequence (Sendshark)
```

## 📧 Email Integration

Downloads automatically:
- Add leads to `leads` table
- Can trigger email automations
- Include download info in metadata

```sql
-- Find leads from downloads
SELECT * FROM leads
WHERE source = 'download'
AND metadata->>'download_id' = 'your-download-id';
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Upload your first lead magnet
2. Create a funnel page with `DownloadGate`
3. Share the link and start capturing leads
4. Monitor downloads in `/downloads` page
5. Set up email automation for new leads
